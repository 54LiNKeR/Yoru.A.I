# Yoru.A.I.
A deeplearning4j project trained to recognise alphabets in one of the s\*xiest languages in Africa. the Yoruba Alphabet. well to be honest Yoruba is one of the razzest languages on the globe but that's not to say it isn't s\*xy to prove this point that's why Africa has a lot of Yoruba demonds(cheating bastards who do it so well) scattered all over the globe. nof said let's get dirty.
